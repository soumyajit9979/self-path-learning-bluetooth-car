# self-path-learning-bluetooth-car

you can run the car anyway you want

anyways, we used l298n while making the final protype
after driving it the way you want, you can stop it, place it were it started from and press the headlight button in the app

this will send the robot to the final destination again, where it came all the way from, within the same path

you can set the speed with analogWrite(); command where so ever you want
